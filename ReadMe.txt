This is my Code Challenge result

Before getting started take note that Chrome does not allow JSON files to be read directly from the file system without modifying Chrome.exe
An example on how to bypass this can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18586921/how-to-launch-html-using-chrome-at-allow-file-access-from-files-mode

Internet Explorer completely blocks reading form the file system through jQuery .Ajax calls.

In a real situation we wouldn't be trying to read a JSON file from the local filesystem.
